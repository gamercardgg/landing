  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>At gamercard.gg, your data is your business, not ours. We're building a platform for gamers, not advertisers.</p>

  <h2>1. No tracking. No ads.</h2>
  <p>We don't use Google Analytics or third-party tracking tools. Only minimal cookies are used and only when necessary for security or functionality. We never sell or share your data with advertisers or third parties.</p>

  <h2>2. Burner emails are welcome.</h2>
  <p>You can use a temporary or masked email to register. Just make sure you still have access in case we need to verify your account or send updates you requested.</p>

  <h2>3. No unnecessary storage.</h2>
  <p>We only store the data you give us, and only for as long as needed to deliver the service. You can delete your data anytime.</p>

  <h2>4. Transparency by default.</h2>
  <p>We believe privacy policies should make sense. If we ever change this policy, we'll explain it clearly and upfront.</p>
